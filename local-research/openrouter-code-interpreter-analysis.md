Based on the codebase, particularly in `src/commands/mcp/client/MCPClient.ts` and `src/commands/mcp/client/errors.ts`, and the research documents provided, here's an analysis of why the Code Interpreter MCP server might fail with OpenRouter but work with Anthropic, and what would be needed to address this:

**Technical Differences in Tool Call Handling (Codebase Analysis):**

1.  **Tool Handling Logic is Primarily Anthropic-Centric:** The `MCPClient.ts` code is structured around Anthropic's tool calling mechanism. This is evident in:
    *   **`processStream` method:** This method contains specific logic to parse Anthropic's streaming `content_block_delta` and `message_delta` events to identify tool use, extract tool names, arguments, and handle tool results. It's designed to work with Anthropic's specific `tool_use` stop reason and `tool_result` message types.
    *   **`initMCPTools` method:** This method is explicitly called only when the provider is Anthropic: `if(provider === 'anthropic') { await this.initMCPTools(); }`. This suggests that tool initialization and handling are assumed to be relevant primarily for Anthropic's API.
    *   **No Tool Handling for OpenRouter:**  When the provider is OpenRouter, the `processStream` method in `MCPClient.ts` has significantly simplified logic that seems to largely ignore tool-specific structures.  It focuses on extracting text content and stop reasons from the generic OpenAI-compatible API response format, but it doesn't attempt to parse or handle tool calls in the same way it does for Anthropic.

2.  **Error Handling Differentiates Providers:** The `src/commands/mcp/client/errors.ts` file shows a clear distinction in error handling:
    *   **`handleOpenRouterError` function:** This function is specifically created to handle OpenRouter-specific errors, checking for HTTP status codes and error codes that are typical of OpenRouter's API responses. It specifically handles `model_not_found`, rate limits, and authentication errors.
    *   **`handleMCPError` function:** This function includes logic to check if an error is an OpenRouter error and then delegates to `handleOpenRouterError`. Otherwise, it handles errors more generically, assuming they might be related to Anthropic or MCP server issues.
    *   **Connection Closed Errors and OpenRouter:**  The `handleOpenRouterError` function includes specific handling for "Connection closed" errors, suggesting that these errors are more prevalent or specifically identified as an issue with OpenRouter integrations.

**Why Code Interpreter Fails with OpenRouter (Based on Code and Research):**

Combining the codebase analysis with the research documents provides a clearer picture:

*   **OpenRouter's API Standardization vs. Anthropic's Tool Calls:** OpenRouter aims to provide a standardized API across different models, often using the OpenAI-compatible API format. However, Anthropic's native API has a specific and well-defined way of handling tool calls within its message structure. The Code Interpreter MCP server is likely designed to interact with Anthropic's native tool call format. OpenRouter's standardization might not perfectly translate Anthropic's tool call mechanism, leading to incompatibility.
*   **Streaming Response Differences:** As noted in `local-research/openrouter-code-interpreter-research.md`, Anthropic's API returns streaming tool calls in a specific way. OpenRouter's proxying and standardization might alter the streaming response format in a way that the Code Interpreter MCP server doesn't expect, causing parsing errors or connection issues.
*   **Connection Closed Errors with OpenRouter:** The `mcp-provider-comparison.md` document highlights that several MCP servers, including Code Interpreter, Browserbase, and Riza, exhibit "Connection closed" errors specifically when used with OpenRouter. This suggests a systemic issue in how OpenRouter handles persistent connections or streaming with certain MCP servers, especially those that heavily rely on tool calls and potentially complex streaming interactions like Code Interpreter.
*   **Lack of Tool Support in OpenRouter's MCP Handling:** The codebase analysis shows that the `MCPClient` largely bypasses tool handling when using OpenRouter. This is likely because, at the time of implementation, OpenRouter's support for Anthropic-style tool calls was either non-existent or not reliably compatible with the MCP server's expectations.

**What Would Be Required to Make Code Interpreter Work with OpenRouter:**

To make the Code Interpreter MCP server function correctly with OpenRouter, significant modifications would be needed:

1.  **Implement OpenRouter-Specific Tool Call Handling:** The `processStream` method in `MCPClient.ts` needs to be extended to understand and process tool calls as represented by OpenRouter, if OpenRouter provides a mechanism for this. This might involve:
    *   Investigating if OpenRouter has any extensions or conventions for representing Anthropic-style tool calls within its OpenAI-compatible API.
    *   If OpenRouter does not directly translate Anthropic's tool calls, a translation or adaptation layer might be needed to convert OpenRouter's response format into something the MCP server expects. This is a complex undertaking as it might require deep understanding of both APIs and the MCP server's internal logic.

2.  **Address Connection Closed Errors:** The root cause of the "Connection closed" errors with OpenRouter needs to be investigated. This could involve:
    *   **Network Protocol Analysis:**  Analyzing the network traffic between the MCP server and OpenRouter to identify any protocol mismatches, timeouts, or errors that lead to connection closures.
    *   **OpenRouter API Investigation:**  Contacting OpenRouter support to inquire about known issues with persistent connections, streaming, or tool calls and MCP-like servers.
    *   **MCP Server Modification (Potentially):** If the issue lies in how the MCP server interacts with the streaming API, modifications to the server's connection handling or streaming parsing logic might be necessary to accommodate OpenRouter's behavior.

3.  **Error Handling Refinement:** Enhance the error handling in `handleOpenRouterError` to specifically identify and manage errors that are unique to Code Interpreter and OpenRouter interactions. This might involve adding more specific error classes or error message parsing to provide more informative feedback to the user when Code Interpreter fails with OpenRouter.

4.  **Thorough Testing and Iteration:** After implementing any changes, extensive testing would be crucial:
    *   **Unit Tests:**  Create unit tests to specifically verify the tool call handling logic for OpenRouter within `MCPClient`.
    *   **Integration Tests:**  Set up integration tests with the Code Interpreter MCP server and OpenRouter to test end-to-end functionality.
    *   **Manual Testing:**  Manually test various Code Interpreter use cases with OpenRouter to ensure it functions reliably and provides the expected results.

In summary, making Code Interpreter work with OpenRouter is not a trivial task. It requires a deep dive into the API differences, potentially significant code modifications to handle OpenRouter's API responses correctly, and a thorough debugging process to resolve the "Connection closed" errors and ensure reliable operation. It's also possible that OpenRouter's current API simply isn't fully compatible with the tool call mechanisms expected by the Code Interpreter MCP server, and complete compatibility might not be achievable without significant changes on either the `cursor-tools` or OpenRouter side.
